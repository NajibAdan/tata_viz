# About
An online retail store has hired me as a consultant to review their data and provide insights that would be valuable to the CEO and CMO of the business. The business has been performing well and the management wants to analyse what the major contributing factors are to the revenue so they can strategically plan for next year.
The leadership is interested in viewing the metrics from both an operations and marketing perspective. Management also intends to expand the business and is interested in seeking guidance into areas that are performing well so they can keep a clear focus on what’s working. They would also like to view different metrics based on the demographic information that is available in the data.

I first framed the [business scenerio](questions_to_ask.md) the questions the business leaders would ask and need answers to, created visualizations on Tableau based on those business scenarios and communicated [findings](script.md) and explained how each finding relates to the business scenario.
